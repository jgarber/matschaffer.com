<h1>404. My bad, dude.</h1>

<p>I don't have anything to show for this page. I tried to redirect any old links, but I guess I missed this one. Check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}">homepage</a> and maybe you'll find what you're looking for there. Or feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email me</a> if you need help finding it.</p>
