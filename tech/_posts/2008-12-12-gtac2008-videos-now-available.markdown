title: GTAC2008 Videos now available
---
Rather than continue my review/rant about GTAC2008, I think I&#8217;ll let you just decide for yourself since the videos are <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/12/posted-by-lydia-ash-gtac-conference.html">now available.</a>

Many of them are less-than-interesting, but the following are probably worth a look.

1. **Boosting Your Testing Productivity with Groovy &#8211; Andres Almiray**<br />
  I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of this stuff with Groovy lately, more detail to follow.
  * Video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvWTfVCWKJY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvWTfVCWKJY</a>

2. **The New Genomics: Software Development at Petabyte Scale &#8211; Matt Wood**<br />It&#8217;s not about testing, but it&#8217;s a good talk.
  * Video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A64WKH9gNI8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A64WKH9gNI8</a>
  * Slides part 1: <a href="http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=dczwht9g_3318qqfb6f5">http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=dczwht9g_3318qqfb6f5</a>

3. **Automated Model-Based Testing of Web Applications &#8211; Atif M. Memon and Oluwaseun Akinmade**<br />Nothing here that you can go and download just yet, but very interesting research.

4. **Atom Publishing Protocol: Testing your Server Implementation &#8211; David Calavera**<br />This gist of this one is really just: check out <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ape/">Ape</a>, it&#8217;s cool. But I think David should also be given a lot of credit for giving a pretty solid talk despite it being his first talk in English. Nice work, David!

*The Future of Testing* by James A. Whittaker is also probably worth a look, but the video is still listed as &#8220;coming soon&#8221;, so I&#8217;ll link to that when it&#8217;s available.

I&#8217;ll discontinue my GTAC2008 recap unless anyone is really dying to hear more of my ranting. More blog posts on my Groovy work to follow.
