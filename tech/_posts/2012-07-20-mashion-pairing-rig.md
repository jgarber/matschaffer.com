title: Mashion's Pairing Rig
---


Here at Mashion, we pair program a lot. We've been iterating through a handful of pairing setups and have finally settled on what I'm happy to call a masterpiece. But first a little bit about how we got there.

First, we decided that having a separate, dedicated pairing machine wasn't practical. Partly for price, but also because we'd have to maintain another machine and the data on it. We didn't want to end up in a case where data we needed was on a machine we were sitting at. So we opted to use our own laptops to power all of our pairing iterations. It also makes for a smooth transition from pairing to soloing since you're able to plug and unplug and the only thing that changes is your screen size.

Originally, we paired side-by-side using a shared single monitor. This worked reasonably well. The biggest pro is that we had the same coding environment for both partners. But being off to the side of the monitor doesn't make for great ergonomics and having a face-to-face conversation doesn't work well. Noticing that your partner is trying to type also a bit harder. And you bump chairs a lot more often than you'd think.

Then we switched to face-to-face pairing on a single desk. This worked better, but since we only used one monitor one partner would be on their laptop. This mismatch was awkward and again not great ergonomics. In exchange, we got good face-to-face discussion, easier non-verbal cues and no chair bumping. Although we did get occasional games of footsie.

At this point we really wanted to address the environment parity problem. We wanted two monitors but how to mirror two displays off of one MacBook? Most solutions to this are expensive and bulky. Thankfully [Jason Garber](http://jasongarber.com/) joined us around this time and had a stroke of genius: Use HDMI splitters which were small, cheap and easy to attach to a laptop. This was the key that let us drive two identical environments off of one standard laptop.

To really put the icing on the cake, we took a cue from Pivotal Labs' [tete-a-tete pairing article](http://pivotallabs.com/users/jsusser/blog/articles/1505-pairing-tete-a-tete) and started working on ways to offset the pair to get better communication. The solution that [Greg Sterndale](http://gregsterndale.com/) came up with was also genius. He noticed out that you can use an Ikea Galant extension as a single desk. Put two of these together and you have two individual desks that take up a little less space than the single larger Galant desk. Total win! Also a lot less footsie.

Finally we finished it off with easily-movable monitor mounts, wireless input devices and some cable clips to make a pairing rig that's there when you need it and gets out of the way when you don't.
