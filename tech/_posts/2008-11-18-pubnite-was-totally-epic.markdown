title: Dude your PubNite was totally epic!
---
I felt a blog post was in order to commemorate a totally epic 2 year anniversary for <a href="http://phillyonrails.org">PhillyOnRails PubNite</a>.Â  We had quite the turnout last night, definitely upwards of 20 people!

Colin took some photos, so I'll lean on him to get them up on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/colinandangie/">his flickr account</a> soon.

A big thank you to everyone that came out and I'm really looking forward to next month!
