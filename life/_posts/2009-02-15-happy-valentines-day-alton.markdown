title: Happy Valentine's Day, Alton

So here's a non-technical tip for you: If you haven't tried <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pan-seared-rib-eye-recipe/index.html">Alton Brown's Pan Seared Ribyeye recipe</a> yet, do it.

We had a quiet Valentine's Day at home yesterday and I tried my hand at steak and potatoes. Alton's steak recipe was awesome and stupid simple. I will definitely be doing this one again.

For the potatoes, I used a <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Rosemary-Red-Potatoes/Detail.aspx">roasted rosemary potatoes</a> recipe that didn't work out quite as well. I've made something like this before, but couldn't find that same recipe so I used this one. But the addition of garlic and onions was a bit much (my usual one is just butter and rosemary). I guess I'll have to experiment to come up with something like my old way of doing it.

Kaori (the culinary genius of the family) made a delicious three-layer chocolate fudge cake for dessert. Yes, that's a layer of fudge around each layer of cake, chocolate cream between the layers and dusted with cocoa powder. Combine that with a hot cup of <a href="http://www.teavana.com/Loose-Leaf-Teas/Black-Tea/Earl-Grey-Flavored-Black-Tea.axd">Earl Grey</a> and we're in business!

I hope everyone else had a lovely Valentine's Day!
